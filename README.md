### HISTORY OF JEUNES ÉTUDIANTS MUSULMANS

Founded in January 2013, JEM’s main goal was always to promote unity under the
banner of love for Allah and His Prophet ﷺ. JEM started as a beautiful dua in the
city of Madinah by the founder and President of the NGO, asking Allah to surround
him by the lovers of the Prophet ﷺ in order to be at the service of His Nation
(Oummah). In the very month of its foundation, was the first ever project of JEM, a
national conference on the life of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ by an international
preacher, Dr Shaykh Jameel Haleem Al Hussayni. By this time, JEM consisted of
dozens of members mainly from the University of Mauritius. Till today JEM consists
of a mix of students and young professionals devoting their time and effort in the
path of Allah. In more than 7 years of existence, JEM has assisted the impoverished


with basic needs distribution, held conferences promoting prophetic values such as
compassion, mercy and love, empowered the youth through formation in both
Islamic courses and life skill activities.
Furthermore, JEM has a long term project running from 2016, ‘Sponsor A Child’
which is an accompaniment of underprivileged kids in their academic path. All in all,
through various other projects, JEM has contributed in helping alleviating poverty,
empowering the youth and promoting prophetic values for the betterment of the
society.
